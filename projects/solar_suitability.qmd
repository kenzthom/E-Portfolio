This project evaluates potential locations for utility-scale (1MW+) solar farm development using a GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The study integrates environmental, technical, and economic considerations to identify areas most suitable for solar farm development. Data incorperated into the mask layer includes:

-   *Agriculture Land Reserve (ALR)*

-   *Water bodies*

-   *Wetlands (treed and non-treed)*

-   *Permanent snow and ice*

-   *Dense forests – canopy cover \> 40%*

-   *Artificial/build environments*

-   *Protected and conserved areas*

-   *Buffers around roads (100m) and major cities (1000m)*

Data incorporated as suitability criterion in the Analytically Hierarchical Process (AHP):

-   *Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)*

-   *Proximity to roads*

-   *Proximity to major cities*

-   *Proximity to existing energy infrastructure (substations)*

-   *Slope*

-   *Aspect*

Using spatial analysis and weighted overlay techniques, I produced a suitability model that highlights optimal locations while minimizing environmental and land-use conflicts. All processing was completed in R at a spatial resolution of 30m in the BC Environmental Albers CRS (EPSG:3005). Upsampling and re-projection has been undergone for web-publishing.

The project demonstrates the application of geospatial tools to renewable energy planning and supports data-driven decision-making for sustainable infrastructure development.

## Suitability Map

Suitability is ranked on a 1-5 scale, with 1 being least suitable and 5 being very suitable.

The mask layer represents unsuitable land where solar farm installations are not feasible or permitted; it is comprised of data layers mentioned about.
