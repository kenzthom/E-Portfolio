Species at risk (SAR), particularly those with specialized habitat requirements, are highly vulnerable to landscape change driven by human activity and development. Protected areas are intended to mitigate these pressures by conserving critical habitats and maintaining biodiversity. However, while national parks encompass a range of ecosystems, certain habitats essential to SAR may be underrepresented within park boundaries and therefore inadequately protected. This national-scale analysis evaluates which SAR occur within Canadian national parks and assesses whether their associated habitats are sufficiently represented. For this study, the analysis focused on terrestrial mammals, with all data processing conducted in Python using Pandas, GeoPandas, and Matplotlib.

# Data

-   SAR Registry (as defined under the Species at Risk Act)

-   GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) Species Occurrence Data

# **Objective 1:** Identify the spatial occurrence of species at risk in Canadian National Parks
