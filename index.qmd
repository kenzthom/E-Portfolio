Hi, I'm Mackenzie Thomson

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Geography from the University of British Columbia and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) under UBC’s Faculty of Forestry. I’m passionate about applying geospatial technologies to better understand and manage our changing environments. I have a background in the forestry industry as a field technician, where I gained experience in field data collection and forest tenure management across British Columbia. Through the MGEM program, I’m expanding my skills in spatial modelling, remote sensing, and geospatial data analysis to address complex environmental challenges. Currently, I’m developing a model to map solar photovoltaic (PV) suitability across BC, integrating environmental, climate, and infrastructure data to support sustainable energy planning – check it out in the ‘Content & Deliverables’ tab!
