### Terrain and Riparian Management Area Analysis

This map visualizes the Nahmint watershed and riparian management areas. This analysis mapped the stream network using a DEM and extracted stream characteristics to quantify riparian reserve and management zones buffers.

### Salmon Stream Network Analysis

This hydrology based analysis applied network topology to evaluate a capability model of salmon habitat along stream segments using linear referencing. This allowed reachable upstream salmon habitat to be visualized and quantified.

### Spatial Interpolation and Visualization of LiDAR Data

This layout provides a side-by-side comparison of different spatial interpolation algorithms. Zonal statistics present differences between elevation and slope rasters produced with Spline, Nearest Neighbour, and Kriging.

### Cartographic Modelling of Old Growth Forest Inventories

A spatial assessment of old-growth forest patches. This map compares the percent of old growth forest, derived from VRI, to provincial targets. It highlights conservation priorities based on forest age and fragmentation metrics.
